# LenovoG570-Hackintosh
Run macOS on your Lenovo G570
This is for systems with no wireless card whitelist, using a supported intel card. Speaking of which, you will need the BIOS mod found in the NeoBlizzard-verbose g570 hackintosh repo.




You will have to download from Releases, as i couldn't upload it to the repo because of GitHub.
